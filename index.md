# Building Mobile apps on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}
{: #about}

You can manage your Mobile apps and the services you deliver into the mobile app through the concept of a Mobile Developer Console Project. You can create a Project using the Mobile developer console. The Mobile developer console brings in the most commonly used services and starter apps in to one place so that you can manage the services from {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} in the context of the Mobile app you are building.

The {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Mobile console allows a mobile developer to create projects starting from a variety of curated starter kits and then add a variety of {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services to the project. The {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services added to the Project and customized SDKs are available to download along with the mobile platform specific configuration.
